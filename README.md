Excited to announce the completion of my new web application, Kai Ruchi, a smart culinary assistant powered by generative AI.

The core mission of Kai Ruchi is to provide a seamless solution to meal planning while actively reducing food waste. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, the app transforms a user-provided list of on-hand ingredients into unique and delicious recipe suggestions.

From a technical standpoint, this project involved:

Backend: Implementing server-side AI logic with Genkit and Next.js Server Actions.
Frontend: Crafting a responsive and visually appealing user interface with React, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.
State Management: Handling client-side state and persistence for features like "Favorites."
Resiliency: Engineering robust error handling with automatic retries for AI model calls to ensure a smooth user experience.
This project was a deep dive into building production-ready, AI-driven web applications.
